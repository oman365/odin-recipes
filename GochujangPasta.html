    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This creamy gochujang pasta is one of the greatest pasta experiences I have ever had. It only takes 20 minutes to make and will be sure to impress your next guest. It looks very similar to a penne a la vodka except it’s not and it’s much better.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200 g dry rigatoni (or pasta of choice)</li>
            <li>50 g pork belly (or 3 slices bacon)</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2.5 tbsp gochujang</li>
            <li>¾ cup milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup pasta water</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin to cook rigatoni according to package instructions in salted water until el dente. Should take about 10 -15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut pork belly into 1 inch pieces and cook over medium heat for 3-5 minutes on each side until nicely browned on each side.</li>
            <li>Remove the pork belly but leave 1 tbsp of the bacon fat.</li>
            <li>Add sliced garlic into the same pan and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add gochujang, and cook while stirring for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add milk, cream, and soy sauce and allow it to simmer for 3 minutes until thickened.</li>
            <li>At this point, the pasta should almost be done cooking. If it isn't ready yet, keep your gochujang sauce pan over low heat until the pasta is ready.</li>
            <li>Add the rigatoni directly into the sauce pan along with the cooked pork belly and starchy pasta water.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat until the sauce is your desired consistency. I like to keep this slightly more saucy so I only let it simmer about 2-3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Optionally top it with parmesan cheese and chopped chives.</li>
        </ol>
